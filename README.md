# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction System
A machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts loan approval based on applicant information.

## 📋 Overview

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The model has been trained on historical loan data and includes comprehensive feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit app with modern UI
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant loan approval predictions
- **Probability Scores**: Shows confidence levels for predictions
- **Personalized Insights**: Provides recommendations based on input data
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes feature importance and model explanations

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier (Hyperparameter Tuned)
- **Training Method**: Cross-validation with GridSearchCV
- **Features**: 13 engineered features including income ratios and credit history
- **Preprocessing**: Automated handling of missing values and categorical encoding

## 📈 Features Used for Prediction

### Input Features:
- **Personal**: Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area
- **Financial**: ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term
- **Credit**: Credit_History

### Engineered Features:
- **TotalIncome**: ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome
- **LoanAmount_to_Income_Ratio**: LoanAmount / TotalIncome

## 🔍 Model Training Process

The model training process (detailed in `main.ipynb`) includes:

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Dataset analysis and visualization
   - Missing value identification

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating derived features
   - Handling categorical variables

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value imputation
   - Feature scaling and encoding
   - Train-test split

4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Multiple algorithms comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Cross-validation
   - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

5. **Model Selection & Saving**
   - Best model selection based on performance
   - Model serialization for deployment

## 📊 Key Insights

### Factors that Increase Approval Chances:
- ✅ Higher total income
- ✅ Good credit history
- ✅ Lower loan-to-income ratio
- ✅ Graduate education
- ✅ Stable employment

### Factors that Decrease Approval Chances:
- ❌ Poor or no credit history
- ❌ High loan-to-income ratio
- ❌ Very low income
- ❌ Too many dependents relative to income
